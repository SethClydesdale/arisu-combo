# Arisu Combo

Arisu Combo is a cute and funny extension for [Brackets](https://brackets.io/) (now [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.io/#/home)) that displays your combo count and an image of Arisu from Blue Archive dancing when you type in the editor. Arisu will change her dance whenever you reach one of the following combo counts: 25, 50, 100.
